# Getting Started with Robotics in the Classroom

Robotics education is becoming increasingly important in modern classrooms. This guide will help you get started with introducing robotics to your students.

## Why Robotics?

Robotics education offers numerous benefits:

- **Problem-solving skills**: Students learn to break down complex problems
- **STEM integration**: Combines science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
- **Creativity**: Encourages innovative thinking and design
- **Career preparation**: Prepares students for future careers in technology

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

There are many robotics platforms available for education:

1. **LEGO Mindstorms** - Great for beginners
2. **Arduino** - More advanced, requires programming
3. **Raspberry Pi** - Full computer capabilities
4. **VEX Robotics** - Competition-focused

### Step 2: Plan Your Curriculum

Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity:

- Week 1-2: Introduction to robotics concepts
- Week 3-4: Basic programming
- Week 5-6: Building first robot
- Week 7-8: Advanced projects

## Example Code

Here's a simple Python example for controlling a robot:

```python
import time

def move_forward(duration):
    """Move robot forward for specified duration"""
    print(f"Moving forward for {duration} seconds")
    time.sleep(duration)
    print("Stopped")

# Main program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    move_forward(5)
```
